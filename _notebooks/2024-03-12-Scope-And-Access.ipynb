    "## Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "- Local variables: variables declared in body of constructors and methods, only use within constructor or method, canâ€™t be declared public or private\n",
    "- If local variable named same as instance variable, within that method the local variable will be referred to instead of the instance variable\n",
    "- Formal parameters and variables declared in a method or constructor can only be used within that method or constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "## Access \n",
    "\n",
    "- Private: Variables or methods marked as private are accessible only within the class in which they are declared. This provides the highest level of encapsulation and restricts access from outside the class.\n",
    "- Package/Default: If no access modifier is specified, the default access level is package-private, also known as default access. This allows access within the same package but restricts access from classes outside the package.\n",
    "- Public: Public members are accessible from any other class. They provide the least restrictive access and are commonly used for methods and variables that need to be accessed from other classes.\n",
